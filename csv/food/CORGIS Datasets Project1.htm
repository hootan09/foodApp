 carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in candy, jams, and desserts). 
Carbohydrates are found in wide variety of foods. The important sources 
are cereals (wheat, maize, rice), potatoes, sugarcane, fruits, table 
sugar(sucrose), bread, milk, etc. Starch and sugar are the important 
carbohydrates in our diet. Starch is abundant in potatoes, maize, rice 
and other cereals. Sugar appears in our diet mainly as sucrose(table 
sugar) which is added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam, 
biscuits and cakes. Glucose and fructose are found naturally in many 
fruits and some vegetables. Glycogen is carbohydrate found in the liver 
and muscles (as animal source). Cellulose in the cell wall of all plant 
tissue is a carbohydrate. It is important in our diet as fibre which 
helps to maintain a healthy digestive system. Measured in grams (g) by

because it is an essential structural component of all animal cell 
membranes; essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and 
fluidity. Cholesterol enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall 
(to protect membrane integrity and cell viability), thereby allowing 
animal cells to change shape and animals to move (unlike bacteria and 
plant cells, which are restricted by their cell walls). Since all animal
 cells manufacture cholesterol, all animal-based foods contain

kcal (37 kJ) per gram. There are nine essential amino acids which humans
 must obtain from their diet in order to prevent protein-energy

from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and 
include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The 
table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a 
disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and 
glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains
 of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances 
may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are

artificial sweeteners. Measure in grams (g).</td>

 to maintain normal nerve and muscle function, supports a healthy immune
 system, keeps the heart beat steady, and helps bones remain strong. It 
also helps regulate blood glucose levels and aid in the production of 
energy and protein. There is ongoing research into the role of magnesium
 in preventing and managing disorders such as high blood pressure, heart
 disease, and diabetes. However, taking magnesium supplements is not 
currently recommended. Diets high in protein, calcium, or vitamin D will
 increase the need for magnesium. Most dietary magnesium comes from
